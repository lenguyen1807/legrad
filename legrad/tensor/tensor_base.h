/**
 * Adapt from Pytorch c10 TensorImpl:
 *
 * Some basic characteristics about our in-memory representation (TensorBase)
 * of tensors:
 *
 *  - It contains a pointer directly to the data and records the
 *    data type and device of the view.  This allows multiple tensors
 *    to alias the same underlying data, which allows to efficiently
 *    implement differing *views* on a tensor.
 *
 *  - The tensor view class itself records view-specific metadata about
 *    the tensor, e.g., sizes, strides and offset into storage.
 *    Each view of a storage can have a different size or offset.
 *
 *  - This class is intrusively refcounted.  It is refcounted so that
 *    we can support prompt deallocation of large tensors; it is
 *    intrusively refcounted so that we can still perform reference
 *    counted operations on raw pointers, which is often more convenient
 *    when passing tensors across language boundaries.
 *
 *  - For backwards-compatibility reasons, a tensor may be in an
 *    uninitialized state.  A tensor may be uninitialized in the following
 *    two ways:
 *
 *      - A tensor may be DTYPE UNINITIALIZED.  A tensor of this
 *        form has an uninitialized dtype.  This situation most
 *        frequently arises when a user writes Tensor x(CPU).  The dtype
 *        is subsequently initialized when mutable_data<T>() is
 *        invoked for the first time.
 *
 *      - A tensor may be STORAGE UNINITIALIZED.  A tensor of this form
 *        has non-zero size, but has a storage with a null data pointer.
 *        This situation most frequently arises when a user calls
 *        Resize() or FreeMemory().  This is because Caffe2 historically
 *        does lazy allocation: allocation of data doesn't occur until
 *        mutable_data<T>() is invoked.  A tensor with zero size is
 *        always storage initialized, because no allocation is necessary
 *        in this case.
 *
 *    All combinations of these two uninitialized states are possible.
 *    Consider the following transcript in idiomatic legrad API:
 *
 *      Tensor x(Device::CPU); // x is storage-initialized, dtype-UNINITIALIZED
 *      x.resize(4); // x is storage-UNINITIALIZED, dtype-UNINITIALIZED
 *      x.realize<float>(); // x is storage-initialized, dtype-initialized
 *      x.free_memory(); // x is storage-UNINITIALIZED, dtype-initialized.
 *
 *    All other fields on tensor are always initialized.  In particular,
 *    size is always valid. (Historically, a tensor declared as Tensor x(CPU)
 *    also had uninitialized size, encoded as numel == -1, but we have now
 *    decided to default to zero size, resulting in numel == 0).
 *
 *    Uninitialized storages MUST be uniquely owned, to keep our model
 *    simple.  Thus, we will reject operations which could cause an
 *    uninitialized storage to become shared (or a shared storage to
 *    become uninitialized, e.g., from FreeMemory).
 *
 *    In practice, tensors which are storage-UNINITIALIZED and
 *    dtype-UNINITIALIZED are *extremely* ephemeral: essentially,
 *    after you do a Resize(), you basically always call mutable_data()
 *    immediately afterwards.  Most functions are not designed to
 *    work if given a storage-UNINITIALIZED, dtype-UNINITIALIZED tensor.
 *
 *    We intend to eliminate all uninitialized states, so that every
 *    tensor is fully initialized in all fields.  Please do not write new code
 *    that depends on these uninitialized states.
